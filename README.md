# Computer Store API – ASP.NET Core Proof of Concept

This project is a backend web API for a fictional computer store, built as a proof of concept using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and Clean Architecture principles. It showcases category and product management, stock import functionality, and discount calculation logic — all covered with unit and integration tests.
